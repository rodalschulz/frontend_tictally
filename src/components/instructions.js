          Here you can set 3 things: core limits, subcategories, and
          subcategory-tracking to establish a 10,000 hour challenge.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          ♦ Core Limits: Determine Core subcategory limits to correctly
          calculate your Core daily total. Example: if you set a limit of 7
          hours for SLEEP, but you input 8 hours of sleep in a day, only 7 hours
          will count towards your total Core time and the rest will be
          classified as WASTE.
        </p>
        <p>
          ♦ Subcategories: Create your custom subcategories for each category.
        </p>
        <p>
          ♦ Tracking: Set already used subcategories to track your progress in
          the 10,000 hour challenge. You'll be able to visualize your progress
          on the Dashboard.
